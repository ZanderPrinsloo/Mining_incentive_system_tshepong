web/queries.py
--------------
All database queries for the Tshepong Stoping Analysis web dashboard.
Uses three views in STPTM4000:
  - GANGPRODUCTIONDETAIL  : one row per (gang, workplace, period) — SQM + bonus components
  - PARTICIPANTSDETAIL    : one row per (employee, period) — individual bonus payments
  - PRODUCTIONWPDETAIL    : one row per (workplace, period) — workplace SQM pre/post adjustment

Key column notes:
  - Bonus columns in GANGPRODUCTIONDETAIL are PER-PERSON amounts.
    Multiply by GANGLABOUR to obtain total gang payout.
  - GANGPRODUCTIONBONUS = GANGFINALBREAKBONUS + GANGFINALSAFETYBONUS (production subtotal).
    NOTE: GANGFINALBREAKBONUS is an aliased name (kept for compatibility with the shared
    GANGPRODUCTIONDETAIL schema used across Harmony sites). At Tshepong it is NOT a flat
    rate-per-m² breaking bonus — the source column is GANGFINALEFFICIENCYBONUS, driven by
    GANGEFFICIENCY (m²/empl). Per the "Thibakotsi Stoping Incentive Scheme Cat 4-8" policy
    (JB_202603_STPTEAM_REV04), teams below the
    entry-level efficiency (Wide Raise panels excluded) earn zero on this component; above
    it, the amount is looked up from an m²-by-team-size table and then adjusted by netting
    (WORKPLACENETTINGRATE) and the B-Reef stope-width factor (B_REEF_SW_FACTOR). We label it
    "Efficiency Bonus" in this app's output to match how it's actually calculated.
  - GANGTOTALSQMADJUSTED repeats across workplace rows for the same gang/period.
    Use MAX() when grouping by gang.
  - WORKPLACETOTALSQM = WPMAXLEDGESQM + WPMAXSTOPESQM per workplace — use SUM() across
    workplaces for "startup SQM" (pre-adjustment).
  - Safety indicators: GANGLTIIND, GANGDRESSINGIND, GANGFATALIND (not GANGSAFETYIND).
  - No MONTHSHIFTS column in GANGPRODUCTIONDETAIL.

# ── PARTICIPANTSDETAIL bonus helper ───────────────────────────────────────────

# PARTICIPANTSDETAIL's own view definition LEFT JOINs GANGLINKEARN on (SECTION, PERIOD, GANG)
# only, with no WORKPLACE in the join condition — but GANGLINKEARN has one row per (gang,
# workplace, period), so any gang that worked more than one workplace in a period fans every
# one of its employees' rows out once per extra workplace. Confirmed on real data: period
# 202606 had 1,503 raw rows in the view vs 1,333 truly distinct ones, inflating that period's
# STM+Safety+Driller total by ~16.5% (R3,931,563.43 shown vs R3,374,177.18 correct). This is a
# bug in the shared database view itself (same flaw found independently in a sibling site's
# database), not something introduced by this app — but since the view can't safely be
# rewritten from here (shared object, other consumers may depend on it), every query that
# reads PARTICIPANTSDETAIL directly must dedupe first.
#
# The duplicate rows are byte-for-byte identical except for CREWNO (the one column the join
# actually contributes) — a narrower dedup key like EMPLOYEE_NO alone is NOT safe: 66
# employees in that same period genuinely have more than one row because they transferred
# gangs mid-period (policy §10.5), and a coarser key would silently merge those real,
# distinct payments. (SECTION, PERIOD, EMPLOYEE_NO, GANG, WAGECODE) is confirmed to reproduce
# the true row count exactly (1,333) against the same period — a plain SELECT DISTINCT across
# all columns gives the same correct count but is far more expensive (a wide multi-column
# distinct over the full multi-period UNION ALL the view is built from — timed out at 120s+
# on real queries); GROUP BY on this narrower key with MAX() on the remaining columns is the
# same dedup, cheaper, because MAX() is safe here — every column being maxed comes from
# PARTICIPANTSEARN (the non-duplicated side of the join), so it's identical across all
# fanned-out copies of a given real row; only CREWNO (from the join) can rarely differ, and
# it isn't used in any bonus calculation, only as a filter elsewhere.
#
# Takes the caller's period filter and applies it BEFORE the GROUP BY, not after — the view
# is a 12-months-and-growing UNION ALL, so deduping the whole thing on every call (then
# filtering the result) meant even a single-period query cost as much as an all-history one.
# Pushing the filter in first cut a full endpoint sweep from 120s+ back close to baseline.

    Total bonus per (section, period, gang) from PARTICIPANTSDETAIL.

    total_bonus = SUM(EMPLOYEESTOPETEAMBONUS) ONLY. Verified per-employee against the source
    system's own EMPLOYEETOTALBONUS column (not exposed by this view), across three periods
    spanning Dec 2025 - Jun 2026 (202512, 202601, 202606): dedupe raw PARTICIPANTSEARN{period}
    to one row per EMPLOYEE_NO (MAX(EMPLOYEETOTALBONUS) — confirmed constant across all of an
    employee's rows in a period, i.e. it's a period-level broadcast, not a per-row figure) and
    SUM — that matches SUM(EMPLOYEESTOPETEAMBONUS) across every raw row with NO dedup needed
    (202606: R2,659,911.34 = R2,659,911.34; 202512: R5,103,029.14 = R5,103,029.14) to the cent.
    EMPLOYEESAFETYBONUS is consistently exactly 20% of EMPLOYEESTOPETEAMBONUS (it's a reported
    breakdown already inside STM, not an addition), and EMPLOYEEDRILLERBONUS is a reference
    rate that does not add to the employee's real payout — even for employees whose
    WAGE_DESCRIPTION is a driller role, EMPLOYEETOTALBONUS still equals just their STM figure.
    Adding safety/driller on top (the old formula) double/triple-counted and was the root
    cause of the 1.20x-2.23x overstatement found when cross-checking against EMPLOYEETOTALBONUS.
    total_safety_bonus/total_driller_bonus are kept as separate informational fields only —
    never sum them into total_bonus.

    KNOWN RESIDUAL (documented, not silently absorbed): 202601 had one row with a nonzero
    EMPLOYEEPENALTY (-694.84, i.e. a credit) that EMPLOYEETOTALBONUS nets against STM but
    EMPLOYEESTOPETEAMBONUS alone does not — EMPLOYEEPENALTY is NOT exposed by PARTICIPANTSDETAIL
    (confirmed via INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS: only EMPLOYEEAWOPPENALTY is), so netting it would
    require bypassing the view and reading raw PARTICIPANTSEARN{period} tables directly —
    a real architecture change to recover a column that was nonzero in only 1 of 1,113 employees
    in the one period it appeared (0 in the other two periods checked), worth ~0.05% of that
    period's total. A separate, unrelated one-off was also found in 202601 (employee Z9150639:
    two same-period rows on different gangs, with the real payout sitting on a zero-STM row) —
    a source-data anomaly, not a formula gap; ~R707 on ~R1.35M for that period.

# Incentive Scheme Cat 4-8" policy, JB_202603_STPTEAM_REV04 (effective March 2026): §5.3/§5.13
# netting, §5.12 B-Reef stoping width, §6.1.3-6.1.6 safety ladder — and the empirically-verified
# netting/B-Reef-SW multiplier found in GANGFULLSTOPINGBONUS → GANGFINALBREAKBONUS.
#
# NOTE on the old m² tier escalator: REV02 (June 2024, the policy this simulator was
# originally built against) had a §5.3 clause paying an extra 5/10/20/30/50% on top of the
# qualifying bonus for teams breaking 300+/400+/500+/600+/700+m². That clause does not exist
# in REV04 — the current policy has no m² tier escalator at all. This matches the database:
# checked GANGFULLSTOPINGBONUS → GANGFINALBREAKBONUS across 39 real gangs spanning every old
# tier band (100m² to 600m²) and the ratio equals netting × B-Reef-SW exactly regardless of
# which band a gang falls in — there is no trace of a tier multiplier being applied. So this
# simulator no longer includes one; it would model a lever that doesn't exist in current policy.
#
# NOTE on Steep Stope (REV04 §5.10/§5.11, new vs REV02): panels with a dip of 35-44° get +10%
# added to their m², and ≥45° get +20% — confirmed directly against PRODUCTIONWPDETAIL, where
# WPTOTALM2 = WPPRETOTALM2 × DIP_FACTOR exactly (e.g. 279 × 1.2 = 334.8). This is a real,
# active mechanism, but unlike netting/SW it operates on the square-metre figure BEFORE the
# efficiency/bonus-table lookup, not as a multiplier on the final Rand bonus. That means it's
# already fully reflected in GANGTOTALSQMADJUSTED (and therefore in every bonus figure derived
# from it) everywhere in this dashboard — no separate lever is needed or possible here, because
# modelling "what if we changed the Steep Stope %" would require re-running the changed m²
# through the underlying bonus-table lookup, which lives in an external calc engine this
# database doesn't expose (only a 2018-dated and a 2026-dated snapshot of the printed tables).

    """Per-gang STOPE BREAKING bonus data for the Bonus Policy Simulator tab.

    Tshepong schema has four bonus components: efficiency, driller, sweeping penalty, safety.
    sweep_penalty is signed (usually ≤0) — GANGFINALSWEEPINGSBONUS is a penalty deduction for
    failing the sweepings standard (policy §5.14), not an actual bonus, despite the column name.
    Adj SQM from GANGTOTALSQMADJUSTED; pre-adj from SUM(WORKPLACETOTALSQM) per gang/period.

    IMPORTANT — dollar totals are anchored to PARTICIPANTSDETAIL, not GANGPRODUCTIONDETAIL:
    GANGPRODUCTIONDETAIL's bonus columns are per-person rates that, multiplied by GANGLABOUR
    (a rounded-up *average* headcount used for the efficiency calc), only ever produce an
    ESTIMATE of the gang's total payout — not the real amount paid to real individuals. That
    estimate was found to diverge from PARTICIPANTSDETAIL (the canonical payroll source, also
    what "Bonus Analysis"/Bonus by Gang Type is built from) by double digits of a percent: for
    one real period range, GANGLABOUR summed to 3,650 "labour units" against 4,220 real
    employee-period records in PARTICIPANTSDETAIL for the identical gangs. So every gang row
    here is re-anchored: Driller and Safety take PARTICIPANTSDETAIL's own EMPLOYEEDRILLERBONUS/
    EMPLOYEESAFETYBONUS totals directly (already isolated there); Efficiency and Sweep are
    bundled into one real figure in PARTICIPANTSDETAIL (EMPLOYEESTOPETEAMBONUS / "STM" —
    confirmed empirically: the raw GANGPRODUCTIONBONUS column equals efficiency + sweep +
    safety, driller excluded), so they're split back out of the real STM total using the
    GANGPRODUCTIONDETAIL estimate's own efficiency:sweep ratio as weights. This means the
    grand total this function returns matches "Bonus by Gang Type"'s Stope Breaking total for
    the same period/section exactly (both ultimately sum PARTICIPANTSDETAIL for the same gang
    keys) — only the split between components, and the lever mechanics, come from the
    GANGPRODUCTIONDETAIL-side estimate, because only it has the raw ingredients (efficiency,
    netting flag, B-Reef factor, safety indicators) the simulator's levers need.

    The (now anchored) Efficiency Bonus is decomposed into a lever-independent "raw_qualifying"
    amount so the simulator can recompute it under different policy parameters instead of just
    scaling the actual paid figure:
        efficiency_bonus_anchored = raw_qualifying × netting_mult × sw_mult × safety_mult
    netting_mult/sw_mult are empirically verified to multiply exactly onto the *estimate*
    (WORKPLACENETTINGRATE and B_REEF_SW_FACTOR multiply exactly onto GANGFULLSTOPINGBONUS to
    produce GANGFINALBREAKBONUS, checked across 39 gangs spanning 100m² to 600m² — also
    confirming there is no tier effect; see BONUS_POLICY_DEFAULTS comment above for why the
    old tier escalator is gone from both the current policy and this model). Applying those
    same verified ratios to the anchored dollar figure is an extrapolation, not something
    independently re-verified against real anchored data — flagged in the simulator UI.
    The entry-level gate is applied separately (a hard cutoff, not a multiplier), using the
    real GANGEFFICIENCY (m²/empl) figure, which the anchoring doesn't touch. Wide Raise
    workplaces (WORKPLACERATETYPE) are exempted from it per policy §5.4, confirmed against
    real low-efficiency Wide Raise gangs that still earn a nonzero efficiency bonus.
    Gangs that already earn $0 (gated below the entry level, or a fatal incident zeroed them
    out) cannot be reconstructed upward — there is no data signal to recover what they would
    have qualified for, so they are flagged "gated" and held at $0 regardless of lever changes.

    Not modelled here (see BONUS_POLICY_DEFAULTS comment for why): the §5.10/§5.11 Steep
    Stope m² uplift (real, active, but already baked into GANGTOTALSQMADJUSTED upstream of
    this data, not a separate Rand lever) and the §6.1.1/§6.1.2 Physical Conditions Rating
    safety forfeiture (searched PRODUCTIONEARN/GANGLINKEARN/RATES for any CONDITION/RATING/
    INSPECT column — none exists, so there's no data to drive it; every "clean" gang in a
    full year of data got exactly the full +25%, zero exceptions, so it either hasn't
    triggered yet or isn't wired into this data source).
